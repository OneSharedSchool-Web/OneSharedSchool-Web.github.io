<h2 class="text-center mt-5 blueS">Our Story</h2>
<p class="boxWidth">
    Laxmi and Guru are adopted and have a vision to change the world.
    So on the 10th anniversary of their adoption, they decided to start a
    family foundation together with their parents.
    They wanted to share their limited resources with other
    children who are not as lucky as they have been and to try to make the world a happier place.
    In the summer of 2017, Guru created a survey, the results
    of which helped shape his and Laxmi’s ideas around eradicating poverty.
    It’s about the small things – think for example about the child
    who cannot get to school as there are no transport systems in place.
    If we gave him one of our old bikes, he could get to school,
    get an education and have a brighter future. As both Laxmi and Guru say:
    "We are not super rich and don't have millions to donate
    but we believe that if all of us share just a bit of what we have, we can end world poverty."
    Our mom talks about poverty elimination through shared systems
    change but to us it’s about sharing a bike for example,
    or a euro a week of our pocket money and in this way connecting to the children we share with.
    The world then really becomes one family!
    This has become the core philosophy of One Family Foundation – <b>shared change</b> - Sharing is caring!
    This led to the One Shared Schools website made by kids for kids!
    Schools in India can tell us what they need to help them provide quality education,
    for example new books. Pupils at a school in the Netherlands can then
    organise a fundraiser or sponsored event to raise the money for the books.
    Schools can make donations through the donate button and we will
    ensure the school in India receives the donation.
    Pupils can stay in contact with one another through the
    website and learn about each other’s lives and exchange
    messages, songs or just chat to each other about daily life.
    One Shared School is one of the projects One Family Foundation.

        <h4>One Family Foundation</h4>
        <p>
            The world is one family and we seek to create partnerships,
            both large and small in order to work together towards a peaceful
            coexistence and initiate the change that is so greatly needed in the world.
            By working together, we can more easily multiply our efforts
            to scale up projects and create the momentum to take them global.​<br>

            The foundation operates as a social innovation incubator,
            facilitating projects in growing to scale both at the national level and globally.
            We are starting with three projects, but we are open to incubating ideas from across the globe.<br>

            Sharing is at the core of all the projects.
            We see shared change as the absolute basic principle to carry our projects forward.
