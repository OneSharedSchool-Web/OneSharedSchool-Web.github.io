        More than 70 schools in India have posted their schools on our website with the items
        which the kids thought were important to make their school function better.
        You can select a school you choose to support and stay in touch with them,
        learning about their lives, swapping information or just chatting.

            <li>Go ahead and make your plans in class on how
                to raise the money that your partner school needs
                for books, classroom equipment,
                a second hand computer, or a water filter for example.
